What is walk forward validation?<br/>
Walk forward validation is a method used in finance and other fields to test the effectiveness of a trading or investment strategy. In this method, the strategy is tested using historical data in a forward-looking manner, with the aim of assessing its performance in real-time trading.<br/>

The basic idea behind walk forward validation is to divide the historical data into two parts: a "training" period and a "testing" period. The training period is used to develop the trading strategy, and the testing period is used to assess its effectiveness. The strategy is then modified and re-optimized using the data from the next training period, and the process is repeated for a series of overlapping testing periods.<br/>

By using this iterative approach, walk forward validation takes into account the fact that market conditions can change over time, and that a strategy that works well in one period may not work as well in another. It also helps to avoid "overfitting" the strategy to the historical data, which can lead to poor performance in real-world trading.<br/>

Overall, walk forward validation is a useful tool for traders and investors who want to develop and test their strategies in a rigorous and systematic way.<br/>
